# Climate Data by State

This web app allows users to select a state from either an interactive map, or a drop-down menu when in mobile mode. 

Based upon their selection, the page will output a table of metrics for that state from the years 2007 to 2014, showing both total carbon emissions of that state, side by side with the state's population from that year.

The page will also generate a visual representation via D3 Bar Chart, to better illustrate the changing trends in populations and carbon emissions, and highlight any interesting trends. 

## MVP

### Start with the general idea
 - This app will search climate data from 2017 in the United States. 
 - It will allow the user to choose a State from a drop-down menu.
 - The app will then display the carbon emissions of that state as a percentage of the national composite, and display them using pie charts overlaying a map of the USA
### Identify the target audience
- Target audience is people who want to view comparative carbon emissions data for education or discussion.
### Identify the problem that the product will address
- This app makes it easier for users to call up statistics that are difficult to visualize and compare, particularly for those who like strong visual aids.
### Write down the primary goal of the product - mission statement
- To allow people to easily retrieve data about carbon emissions and view their home state's share in the USA.
### Identify and prioritize user stories
